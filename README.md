# Word frequency in a song

This code shows the frecuency of each word existing in a song lyrics.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

- Iterate a String with For cylcle.
- Make a horizontal bar graph with [Maptolotlib library](https://matplotlib.org/).

## How does it work?

Once you execute the file [Code.py](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/word-frequency-in-a-song/blob/main/Code.py) a horizontal bar graph will be deployed showing the frecuency of each word existing in a song lyrics.

By default, the input son is Lost On You by LP, if you want to execute the program with another song you simply have to replace the variable "cancion" in the [Code.py](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/word-frequency-in-a-song/blob/main/Code.py) file with the lyrics of the song you want.
